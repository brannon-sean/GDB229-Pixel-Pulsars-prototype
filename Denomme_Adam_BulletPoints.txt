Goals for Next Part of the Project on my end:

- Add Death Barrier Outside of Map or Function to Teleport Player back to spawnPoint for when player gets shoved off the map
- Clean Up Inventory UI to make it not seem like useable items
- Make Level Up Screen/Menu Similar to how baldurs gate and WoW have a plus button on the bottom that you can click on at anytime
- Add Time between waves (Fun Fact: I got this to work but it was corrupted when the github disaster corrupted)
- Add Animation to MachineGunner Boss. (I want to go into Unity or Blender and create both a running animation where he lifts up and puts down the handles to the gun, and I want to make an idle animation where he leans over and rests on the gun a bit.
- Add Ammo, Reload, and Reload Animation
